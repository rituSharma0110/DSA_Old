1. In the very first iteration the largest element reaches the end index
2. That is why we take inner loop from array.lenght-i-1
3. isSwapped is written in the outer loop as we know that if even the single swap does not occurs in the inner loop, then array is sorted.
4. Bubble sort is also known as sink sort as the larger elements sinks first
5. It is also known as inplace sorting as no extra copy(or extra space) of array is being made.
6. It is also a stable algorithm ( revise in your mind).
7. Best case complexity O(n).
8. Worst case complexity O(n^2).
