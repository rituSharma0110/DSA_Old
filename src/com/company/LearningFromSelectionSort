1. In selection sort we select largest or smallest value and then we place it at right position.
2. for finding min we run loop from "firstIndex" as the smallest value has already been placed at first position.
3. It is unstable in nature .
4. It is not an inplace algo as we created a min variable.
5. Best case complexity is O(n^2).
6. Worst case complexity is also O(n^2).
